Welcome!

Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) tool that helps secure services and applications by providing authentication.

ðŸ”¹ What's Our approach?

    
    Our approach is simple: 

    install Keycloak, spin it up, and connect it to a 
    basic Node.js app to get familiar with its essentials. 

    Throughout this series, weâ€™ll focus on practical
    implementations while shedding light on the key 
    theoretical concepts that make it all work.

    By the end, youâ€™ll be equipped to seamlessly manage
    authentication and authorization in your pplications.
